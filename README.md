# node-sys
Node-sys is a new project based on nodejs to extract and transmit technical and application metrics such as telegraf and exporters.  
The idea is to use the astronimic library that nodejs and npm offer to capture and send metrics to other media regardless of platform, system, technology.
Why ?
 - Because telegraf and node exporter not work on the old systems
 - Because nodejs is very rich
 - Becouse nodejs is simply or not...
 - Because i need to send any metrics to several storages like influxd, prometheus, files, ...
